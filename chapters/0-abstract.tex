{\LARGE{\textbf{Abstract}}}

Regular Expressions is one of the most crucial tools for pattern matching, also known as regex.
Modern versions of regex provide advanced features such as lookarounds and capture groups.
These advanced features are less studied and most regex engines implement them using backtracking
which can lead to exponential complexity and ReDoS, Regular Expression Denial of Service.
To avoid this, modern engine provide tools such as for example Atomic Groups in Javascript
to force the behaviour of the engine to avoid the backtracking.

This project contains new algorithms that can be used in the specific case of the PikeVM for lookarounds,
capture groups and atomic groups.
