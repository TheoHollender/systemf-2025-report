{\LARGE{\textbf{Abstract}}}

Regular Expressions are one of the most crucial tools for pattern matching, also known as regex.
Modern versions of regex provide advanced features such as lookarounds and capture groups.
These advanced features are less studied and most regex engines implement them using backtracking
which can lead to exponential complexity and ReDoS, Regular Expression Denial of Service.
To avoid this, modern engines provide tools such as atomic groups in Javascript
to force the behavior of the engine to avoid the backtracking.

This project presents new algorithms for handling capture groups, lookarounds and atomic groups
in the PikeVM with improved time or space complexity.
