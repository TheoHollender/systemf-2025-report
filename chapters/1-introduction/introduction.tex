A regex is a syntax used to define a pattern
that can then be matched against strings for
validation or data extraction.

To represent a regex $r$, one usually uses its
non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA)
\cite{thompson_programming_1968}, computed in $O(|r|)$
time complexity and which has $O(|r|)$ nodes.

In the context of a regex, a capturing group $(X)$ can be used for the
extraction of subpatterns in a string. For example, one could use the regex
$(\textbackslash d \{ 4 \})-(\textbackslash d \{ 2 \})-(\textbackslash d \{ 2 \})$
to extract the year, month and day from a date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

To account for this, some special nodes are added to the NFA that
perform an action when visited, such as tracking the current string
position. For example, the node $\#1:entry$ keeps track of the index
of the string at which it entered the group $1$.
