The planned timeline and real timeline differ starting upon
the discovery of a potential bug in the \cite{weirich_efficient_2024}
paper for the specific case of $\epsilon$-loops, which took a few weeks
to understand, and to try and see what was the impact on the solutions
we had found, which delayed the timeline by a few weeks.

        \raggedright Capture Groups optimization & Week 1-2 & Week 1-3 \\ \hline
        \raggedright Understanding Atomic Group Papers \cite{weirich_efficient_2024} & Week 3-5 & Week 4-6 \\ \hline
        \raggedright Studying $\epsilon$-loop bug & Not Planned & Week 7-9 \\ \hline
        \raggedright Atomic Groups for PikeVM & Week 3-5 & Week 10-11 \\ \hline
        \raggedright Implementation on PikeVM & Not Planned & Week 12-13 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

In the end, I did not have time to look for better results on lookarounds than the
backtracking optimization. The implementation of atomic groups wasn't
finished yet as the focus was changed to writing the report.
